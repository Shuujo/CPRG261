            William Afton was the main antagonist of the Five Nights at Freddy's Clickteam Series.

            He was the co-founder and owner of Fazbear Entertainment and Afton Robotics, LLC, as well as a serial killer directly and indirectly responsible for most of the incidents and tragedies throughout the series, including being the culprit involved in The Missing Children Incident. Afton's role in the series is pivotal, yet his legacy seems to be carried on by The Mimic (who may have also been Glitchtrap and Burntrap).
